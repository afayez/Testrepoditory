# Testrepoditory

For this repository, I just wanted to test it out.

For the main project, We wanted to make a linked list, each node in the linked list represents a city and what the city has to offer.
The program will take the user through the linked list as if they're going on a trip, but before they go, they set a budget for themselves
so which they can spend at each city, if their funds are too low to afford whatever the city, the program will state as such and not allow
to buy whatever the city is offering.
